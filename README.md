## Use Instructions:
1. You will need a browser extension that lets you run userscripts. I like [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) but there are several options you can use that will work equally well. Install the extension and give it the recommended set of permissions.
2. Install the userscript for your question platform of choice. Follow your userscript extension's directions to install a userscript. Links to userscripts: [Amboss](https://github.com/sidlim/8BitDo-Questions/blob/main/amboss.user.js)
3. Toggle the userscript on for the Amboss website.
### Amboss:
1. Connect your controller
2. Open up a question session
3. Map your keys
4. Do questions!
### Uworld:
Work in progress, not at all ready to use. I don't personally use UWorld as much, so I'm not as speedy with development here. If you're looking for something, feel free to fork and develop.
